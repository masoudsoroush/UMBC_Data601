# A Report on World Happiness
## Summary
The World Happiness Report (https://worldhappiness.report/) has conducted numerous surveys to quantify and find the state of happiness in the world. Moreover, the World Happiness Report uses the data of Gallup World Poll for its rankings among countries. In thier studies and surveys of the World Happiness Report, 158 countries have participated. In our study, we will focus on the status of world happiness for 5 consecutive years 2015-2019. Among the so many considered parameters in WHR, we will focus only on a small subset of the most infuential parameters, namely
1. GDP per Capita
2. Health
3. Freedom
4. Corruption
5. Generosity

## Goals


## Conclusions


## Limitations
The facts we found in our study are subject to the following (and possibly more) limitations:
1. Our study concerns a very short period of time (2015-2019). Considering a longer period, some of the above conclusions may or may not change.
2. In our study, we concentrated on only five relevant parameters. Enlarging the set of relevant parameters (e.g. including family status, social support, and etc.) can enrich the findings of this study.
