# A Report on World Happiness
![](Happiness.png)

## Summary
The World Happiness Report (https://worldhappiness.report/) has conducted numerous surveys to quantify and to find the state of happiness in the world. The World Happiness Report partially uses the data of Gallup World Poll for its rankings among countries. In thier studies and surveys of the World Happiness Report, 158 countries have participated. In our project, we will focus on the status of the world happiness for 5 consecutive years 2015-2019. Among the so many considered parameters in WHR, we will only focus on a small subset of the most infuential parameters, namely
1. GDP per Capita
2. Health
3. Freedom
4. Generosity
5. Corruption

We will look for correlations between the Happiness Score and the above parameters.

## Goals
In our study, we will specifically look for conceivable answers to the following questions:
1. How is each one of the above parameters correlated with the Happiness Score?
2. Which of the above paratmeters is the most influential on the Happiness Score?
3. Which of the above parameters is the least relevant factor for the Happiness Score? 
4. Are there any correlations between the above 5 parameters? For instance, is there a relation between GDP per Capita and Health? Are citizens of wealthier countries expected to be healthier than the citizens of less wealthier countries? How about GDP per Capita and Generosity? Are citizens of wealthier countries expected to be more generous? How about GDP per Capita and Corruption? Are wealthier countries supposed to have a lower level of corruption? Is there any correlation between the wealth (measured by GDP per Capita) of a country and its level of social and individual freedom?  


## Conclusions
Our study reaches the following conclusions:
1. All the above 5 parameters are positively correlated with the Happiness Score. The existence of a postive correlation between the first 4 parameters (GDP per Capita, Health, Freedom, and Generosity) and the Happiness Score is in accordance with our intuition. However, the existence of a postive correlation between the corruption level and the Happiness Score is counterintuitive. The data suggests that overall there exists a higher level of corruption in happier countries! 
2. We found that among the above parameters, GDP per Capita is the most influential factor for a having higher Happiness Score.
3. We found that among the above parameters, generosity is the least influential factor for a having higher Happiness Score.
4. We found that there exists a strong positive correlation between GDP per Capita of a nation and the Health of its citizens. That is, the wealthier a country is, the healthier its citizens will be.
5. The analysis shows that the data supports a positive correlation between GDP per Capita of a nation and the Freedom of its citizens. However, the correlation is not as strong as the correlation between GDP per Capita and the Health. 
6. We surprisingly found that the data does not support any correlation between GDP per Capita of a nation and the Generosity of its citizens! Therefore, the citizens of wealthier countries do not necessarily seem to be more generous than the citizens of less wealthier countries.

## Limitations
The facts we found in our study are subject to the following (and possibly more) limitations:
1. Our study concerns a very short period of time (2015-2019). Considering a longer period, some of the above conclusions may or may not change.
2. In our study, we concentrated on only five relevant parameters. Enlarging the set of relevant parameters (e.g. including family status, social support, law enforcement and etc.) can enrich the findings of this study.
