# A Report on World Happiness
## Summary
The World Happiness Report (https://worldhappiness.report/) has conducted numerous surveys to quantify and find the state of happiness in the world. Moreover, the World Happiness Report uses the data of Gallup World Poll for its rankings among countries. In thier studies and surveys of the World Happiness Report, 158 countries have participated. In our study, we will focus on the status of the world happiness for 5 consecutive years 2015-2019. Among the so many considered parameters in WHR, we will focus only on a small subset of the most infuential parameters, namely
1. GDP per Capita
2. Health
3. Freedom
4. Generosity
5. Corruption

We will look for the correlation between the Happiness Score and the above parameters.

## Goals
In our study, we will specifically look for conceivable answers for the following questions:
1. How is each one of the above parameters correlated with the Happiness Score?
2. Which of the above paratmeters is the most influential on the Happiness Score?
3. Which of the above parameters is the least relevant factor for the Happiness Score? 
4. Are there any correlation between the above 5 parameters? For instance, is there a relation between GDP per Capita and Health? Are citizens of wealthier countries expected to be healthier than the citizens of less wealthier countries? How about GDP per Capita and Generosity? Are citizens of wealthier countries expected to be more generous? How about GDP per Capita and Corruption? Are wealthier countries supposed to have a lower level of corruption? Is there any correlation between the wealth (measured by GDP per Capita) of country and the level of social and individual freedom?  


## Conclusions
Our study reaches the following conclusions:
1. All the above 5 parameters are positively correlated with the Happiness Score. The existence of a postive correlation between the first 4 parameters (GDP per Capita, Health, Freedom, and Generosity) is in accordance with the intuition. However, the existence of a postive correlation between Corruption and the Happiness Score is counterintuitive. 

## Limitations
The facts we found in our study are subject to the following (and possibly more) limitations:
1. Our study concerns a very short period of time (2015-2019). Considering a longer period, some of the above conclusions may or may not change.
2. In our study, we concentrated on only five relevant parameters. Enlarging the set of relevant parameters (e.g. including family status, social support, law enforcement and etc.) can enrich the findings of this study.
