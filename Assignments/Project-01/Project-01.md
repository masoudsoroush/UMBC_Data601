## Overview 
The major weather indicators of Seattle's weather have been recorded for more than 25000 consecutive days from 1948 to 2017. This data set is publicly accessible at Kaggle. In this data set, the minimum and the maximum temperatures of each day of the year for the period 1948 to 2017 have been recorded. Moreover, the rain situation for each day has been recorded as a True/False boolean variable. In a seperate column, the precipitation rates for rainy days have been recorded as well. In this project, we would like to employ the logistic regression method to build a simple model for predicting whether a typical day will be rainy.
